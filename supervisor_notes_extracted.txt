51 PROJECT OVERVIEW AND REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS

52 [Titre1] Introduction

53 This introductory chapter presents the scope of the end-of-studies project conducted within in2-Technologies in the context of the EYES (EYE-D) solution. It introduces the hosting organization, clarifies the project context, and formalizes the problem statement and objectives. It also provides a high-level overview of the adopted approach, with particular emphasis on producing computer vision models that are compatible with deployment constraints on NPU-based systems.

54 [Titre1] Host Organization Presentation

55 [Titre2] 2.1 in2-Technologies

56 in2-Technologies is an IT company that positions itself around digital innovation by delivering solutions that combine software engineering, creative design, and advanced technologies. In particular, the organization emphasizes applied Artificial Intelligence as a practical lever to deliver real-world value (Figure 1.1 (a)).

57 According to the public communications provided for this report, in2-Technologies is actively involved in the innovation ecosystem through participation in events and technology programs. These activities help connect the company with partners and stakeholders, and they support continuous improvement by confronting products with real deployment needs.

58 In this context, in2-Technologies develops EYES, an AI-driven solution focused on video analytics and on-device intelligence.

59 [Titre2] 2.2  (EYE-D)

60 EYES is an AI-driven soluion developed within in2-Technologies and centered on computer vision and video analytics. It is presented as an approach that transforms existing video surveillance infrastructures into a system capable of producing actionable insights (Figure 1.1 (b)).

61 Based on the provided communication materials, EYES is designed to integrate with existing camera networks and perform on-site processing. This positioning aims to reduce dependence on cloud processing, improve responsiveness, and address operational constraints such as privacy considerations and deployment cost.

62 EYES is also described as modular and expandable, enabling the activation or integration of AI modules according to the targeted needs. The communication materials highlight use  Case related to security monitoring and industrial safety, with real-time alerting and reporting.

63 From an operational perspective, the provided materials emphasize the following aspects:

64 Integration: EYES connects to an existing camera network and can be installed with minimal disruption.

65 On-device processing: video analytics are executed locally to provide real-time insights and to reduce reliance on external connectivity.

66 Expandable modules: the solution supports an evolving library of AI modules that can be enabled according to the deployment context.

67 Monitoring and reporting: the solution provides alerts and reporting capabilities to support operational decision-making.

68 The EYES brochure highlights a range of security and industrial safety features, including access control and intrusion detection, people and vehicle detection, fire and emergency response related detection, and safety compliance monitoring. These capabilities motivate the need for robust, efficient, and deployable computer vision models under edge constraints, which is the focus of this project.

69 According to the public information provided for this report, EYES has been highlighted through multiple milestones and participations, including:

75 [Titre2] 3.1 Project Context

76 This project is part of the final study program aiming to obtain the Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from the Higher Institute of Computer Science and Mathematics of Monastir. The project is carried out within the company in2-Technologies. The project focuses on developing and deploying computer vision models on constrained embedded platforms with NPU (Neural Processing Unit ) accelerators. Target hardware details are confidential ( under a signed NDA).

77 Within the EYES context, the project contributes to an applied video analytics solution where on-device inference is required for responsiveness, operational constraints, and deployment practicality. The scope of the work includes a set of computer vision tasks required by the solution, covering multiple model families. The overall goal is not limited to training models, but extends to building complete and reliable pipelines that support deployment and monitoring in realistic operational conditions.

78 [Titre2] 3.2 Problem Statement

79 Although computer vision models can achieve strong accuracy in research settings, deploying them on NPU-based platforms introduces several constraints and practical difficulties. In particular, the project must address the following issues:

80 [Paragraphedeliste] Deployment constraints: limited memory and compute budgets, strict latency requirements, and limited operator support depending on the target accelerator.

81 [Paragraphedeliste] Model portability: ensuring that trained models can be exported to an interoperable format (e.g., ONNX) and then converted into optimized inference artifacts.

82 [Paragraphedeliste] Performance trade-offs: balancing accuracy, inference speed, and power consumption when selecting architectures and optimization strategies.

83 [Paragraphedeliste] Pipeline robustness: handling runtime failures and edge cases through systematic error handling and stable orchestration across multiple vision tasks.

84 [Titre2] Project Purpose

85 The main objective of this project is to design an end-to-end workflow that produces computer vision models fit for NPU deployment while maintaining reliable inference pipelines for EYES.

86 The following guiding questions and objectives summarize the expected contribution of the project.

125 [Titre1] Adopted Project Management Methodology

126 The project is conducted using an iterative approach that allows incremental delivery and continuous validation. This approach is suitable for AI engineering workflows where model performance, deployment compatibility, and resource constraints must be checked throughout the development cycle.

127 For this project, we adopt the Scrum methodology as an Agile project management framework. The work is organized into time-boxed sprints, enabling regular planning, implementation, and review cycles. This organization supports continuous refinement of both model quality and deployment readiness.
